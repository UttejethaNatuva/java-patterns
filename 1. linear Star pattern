 Line Star Pattern in Java
This simple Java program prints a straight horizontal line of stars (*) based on user input. 
The user provides a number n, and the program prints n+1 stars in a single line, each separated by a space.


import java.util.*;
public class Linestar {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner  sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) {
			System.out.print("*"+" ");
		}
		
	}

}


Example Output:

Input: 5  
Output: * * * * * * 


 Concepts Used:

Basic for loop

User input with Scanner

Printing patterns with System.out.print()

This is a foundational program for learning how loops and user input work in Java.
